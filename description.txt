A user submits a plain text diagram description to the orchestator. The
orchestrator adds the description to a plain text prompt which it sends to a
formatter LLM, which responds with a bulleted list of interactions called a
spec. The orchestrator sends that spec to a diagrammer llm which responds with
diagram source code. The orchestrator sends the diagram source code to the
digramming tool which responds with a PNG diagram image. Finally, the
orchestrator returns the diagram image to the user.
