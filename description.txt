A user submits a plain text diagram description to the orchestator service. The
orchestrator service adds the description to a plain text prompt which it sends
to a formatter LLM, which responds with a bulleted list of interactions. The
orchestrator service sends that interaction list to a diagrammer llm which
responds with diagram source code. The orchestrator service sends the diagram
source code to the digramming tool which responds with a PNG diagram image. The
orchestrator service returns the diagram image to the user.
